                <p>Tom Proost has been passionate about music, sound and technology ever since he was a child.
                    After his studies to become an industrial engineer, he trained in London to gain more in-depth knowledge of production and technology.
                    He currently combines both worlds. He works in an R & D team at NXP software. Next to this he mixes as an audio engineer both live and in the studio for,
                    among others, Raymond van het Groenewoud.
                    For a long time fascinated by TED, he did translations in the past and now he goes for the challenge with TEDxMechelen.</p>

                <p>Steven Dierckx is a busy, creative generalist who likes to roll up
                    his sleeves and get his hands dirty. He has a background in engineering
                    and construction, which he likes to use both professionally
                    and in his spare time with his own renovation project. For many
                    years he was co-organizer of a local festival, has been growing
                    Christmas trees for ten years and is part of an investors club. So
                    Steven can be described as having an entrepreneurial spirit with
                    a passion for organizing. This in combination with his love for new
                    ideas and innovation makes him an ideal candidate to put his
                    shoulders under TEDx-Mechelen.</p>

                    Chris is the CEO of a sales consultancy company that provides
                    commercial and strategic support for IT companies. With his education
                    in IT and more than 10 years of experience in sales, combined,
                    he gained the experience to support others in this. In addition,
                    he is involved in organizations such as Toastmasters and JCI,
                    in which he has had positions in the board of directors. By constantly
                    looking for innovation, he came into contact with the TEDx
                    concept a few years ago. It is ultimately through the establishment
                    of an event in his hometown Mechelen that led him to participate.

                <p>Hans Verbist started as a graduate in Informatica in education,
                    responsible for the management and expansion of the IT infrastructure
                    for a large number of Mechelen schools. After more than
                    12 years of experience in this sector, his interest within the IT
                    sector turned mainly to IT security. Here he has also adjusted his
                    professional goals and exchanged his previous job for that of
                    cyber security expert. In addition, Hans is organizing the National
                    Childrenâ€™s Cancer Day for which he has been committed for years
                    without any interest. His knowledge of event management is an
                    important link where he can provide added value for TEDxMechelen.</p>
