                x = independently organized event</h3>

            <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program
                of local, self-organized events that bring people together
                to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED
                Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion
                and connection. These local, self-organized
                events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized
                TED event. The TED Conference provides general
                guidance for the TEDx program, but individual
                TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules
                and regulations.)</p>

            <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth
                Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California
                30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with
                multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences
                invite the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak for
                18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made
                available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included
                Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard
                Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-
                Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel
                Kahneman.</p>

            <p>The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in
                Vancouver, British Columbia. TED’s media
                initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are
                posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which
                provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as
                translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational
                initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED
                Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to
                change the world get help translating their wishes into
                action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in
                hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around
                the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-
                changing innovators from around the globe to amplify
                the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>
