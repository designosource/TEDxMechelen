            <p>
                “Revolution” is the theme for our first edition. A logical choice. Today we are living in revolutionary
                times, in
                which totaly new technological and social evolutions are drastically transforming our environment. And
                this at
                an incredible fast pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of us has a choice to make at such a moment. Either passively, incomprehensible but also powerless,
                watching what is happening before our eyes. Either constantly exposing yourself to new information,
                exploring
                and understanding, and actively asking yourself how you can use this knowledge in your life. How to get
                ahead of the curve.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are choosing for the second option, and will be organizing this TEDx conference for others who strive
                for
                the same. Not your background, your color, age or diploma are important, but the attitude with which you
                live.
                That unrelenting curiosity that typifies every TED (x) fan.
            </p>
            <p>
                After all, our choice for “Revolution” also says something for the ambition level that we want to impose
                on ourselves.
                Every speaker must be able to outline the revolution within his or her field in 18 minutes. If we won’t
                see our participants’ jaw drop from time to time, we cannot consider our mission a succes.
